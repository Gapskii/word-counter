# WORD-COUNTER

This project is a word-counter

## Motivation

It was made as a task/challenge for a job application, in accord to the following parameters:

>As a user, I want to visualize a app that contains a form, with a text input in which I may
>freely write, without any character limitation. When I click the "count words" >button, the
>result with the number of written words should appear on the screen. If the texbox is empty
>when I click the button, I should see a error message indicating that >filling the textbox is needed.
>
>As a developer, I wish to look at the project and know how to execute it on my own pc."

## Features

It's main features are a _not entirely_ draggable textbox, where there's no character limit, a button which resolves the function that calculates the number of words and an output box in which the result will appear.

The coloring was done on CSS from a basic knowledge from the aimed company's palette.
